## 🕹️ Linear Regression

## 🎮 Purpose

## 🔧 Linear Regression Formula

The Linear regression equation is represented as:

$$
\huge
ŷ = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + ... + b_nX_n
$$

### Where:

- $$ŷ$$: Dependent variable. 
- $$b_0$$: y-intercept (constant term). 
- $$b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$$: Slope coefficients. 
- $$X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$$: Independent variables.

This formula is used in linear regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line.

## 🕹️ Logistic Regression
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logistic regression, known as a logit model, is a data analysis technique that uses mathematics to predict a binary outcome based on prior observations of a data set. This is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

## 🎮 Purpose
- To predict binary or categorical outcomes.
- To estimate the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular category.

## 🔧 Logistic Regression Formula

The logistic regression equation is represented as:

$$
\huge
\ln \left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3X_3 + b_4X_4
$$

### Where:
- $$p$$: Probability of the event occurring.
- $$\(\frac{p}{1 - p}\)$$: Odds of the event occurring.
- $$\(\ln \left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right)\)$$: Natural logarithm of the odds.
- $$\(b_0\)$$: Intercept.
- $$\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\)$$: Coefficients for the independent variables.
- $$\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4\)$$: Independent variables.

This formula is used in logistic regression to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables.


## 🏁 Some Use Cases
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- Predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on demographic features.
- Diagnosing diseases as positive or negative based on symptoms and test results.

## 🍄About Mushroom Dataset

## 🍄Content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

## 🍄Dataset Details
- **Number of Instances:** 8,124

- **Number of Attributes:** 22

- **Independent Variables:** All the attributes except for the class (e.g., cap shape, cap color, odor, etc.) that will be used to predict the outcome.
  
- **Dependent Variable:** Class (Edible or Poisonous) - the outcome variable that the analysis aims to predict.


## 🍄Attributes

Each mushroom in the dataset is described by the following features:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this step, every letter in the data will be converted into numerical values because the model is designed to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable (the output) and one or more independent variables (the inputs).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this mushroom dataset, we assigned the following numerical values to the corresponding letters:
