 ###
 
## 🕹️ Linear Regression
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This form of analysis estimates the coefficients of the linear equation, involving one or more independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable. Linear regression fits a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between predicted and actual output values. 


## 🎮 Purpose
- To predict continuous outcomes based on the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
- To estimate the expected value of the dependent variable when given a specific value for the independent variable.
- To understand and quantify the strength and nature (positive/negative) of relationships between variables.

## 🔧 Linear Regression Formula

The Linear regression equation is represented as:

$$
\huge
ŷ = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + ... + b_nX_n
$$

### Where:

- $$ŷ$$: Dependent variable. 
- $$b_0$$: y-intercept (constant term). 
- $$b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$$: Slope coefficients. 
- $$X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$$: Independent variables.

This formula is used in linear regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line.

## 🏁 Some Use Cases

- Estimating student performance based on hours studied, attendance rate, and previous test scores.
- Forecasting monthly electricity bills based on household size and appliance usage.
- Forecasting the number of product sales based on advertising spend.

 <h1 align="center"> 🌟🦖All About Logistic Regression🦖🌟

 ###
 
## 🕹️ Logistic Regression
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logistic regression, known as a logit model, is a data analysis technique that uses mathematics to predict a binary outcome based on prior observations of a data set. This is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

## 🎮 Purpose
- To predict binary or categorical outcomes.
- To estimate the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular category.

## 🔧 Logistic Regression Formula

The logistic regression equation is represented as:

$$
\huge
\ln \left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3X_3 + b_4X_4
$$

### Where:
- $$p$$: Probability of the event occurring.
- $$\(\frac{p}{1 - p}\)$$: Odds of the event occurring.
- $$\(\ln \left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right)\)$$: Natural logarithm of the odds.
- $$\(b_0\)$$: Intercept.
- $$\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\)$$: Coefficients for the independent variables.
- $$\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4\)$$: Independent variables.

This formula is used in logistic regression to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables.


## 🏁 Some Use Cases
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- Predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on demographic features.
- Diagnosing diseases as positive or negative based on symptoms and test results.

## 🪻About Iris Dataset

## 🪻Content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.[1] It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.[2] Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".[3]

## 🍄About Mushroom Dataset

## 🍄Content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

## 🍄Dataset Details
- **Number of Instances:** 8,124

- **Number of Attributes:** 22

- **Independent Variables:** All the attributes except for the class (e.g., cap shape, cap color, odor, etc.) that will be used to predict the outcome.
  
- **Dependent Variable:** Class (Edible or Poisonous) - the outcome variable that the analysis aims to predict.


## 🍄Attributes

Each mushroom in the dataset is described by the following features:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this step, every letter in the data will be converted into numerical values because the model is designed to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable (the output) and one or more independent variables (the inputs).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this mushroom dataset, we assigned the following numerical values to the corresponding letters:

**🍄 Step 2. Perform Data Cleaning**

![vs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7cd3670-f80f-4b43-91f9-66055d2c7653)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After converting letters to numbers, we can perform data cleaning if we find any missing values in our given dataset.
In the case of the mushroom dataset, we observed that there are many missing values under column L, which is the stalk-root column.

Aside from checking manually, we can also use VS Code to locate missing values in our dataset by inputting the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('mushroom.csv')  # The file name depends on your assigned file name

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print("Preview of the dataset:")
print(data.head())

# Check for missing values in each column
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()

# Display the count of missing values for each column
print("\nMissing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)

# Find the rows with missing values
missing_rows = data[data.isnull().any(axis=1)]

# Display the rows with missing values
print("Rows with missing values:")
print(missing_rows)

# Step 1: Handle missing values
# Fill missing numeric values with the mode of the respective columns
data['stalk-root'].fillna(data['stalk-root'].mode()[0], inplace=True)

# Save the cleaned dataset
cleaned_file_path = 'C:/Users/Ralph/Downloads/Cleaned_Mushroom.csv' #Depends on your assigned file name
data.to_csv(cleaned_file_path, index=False)

print("Data cleaning process completed and saved to:", cleaned_file_path)

```
**Explanation of the Code**

**1. Load the Dataset:** The dataset is loaded from a specified CSV file.

**2. Preview the Dataset:** The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to give an overview of its contents.

**3. Check for Missing Values:** The code checks for missing values in each column and prints the count.

**4. Identify Rows with Missing Values:** It identifies and prints the rows that contain any missing values.

**5. Handle Missing Values:** We use the mode for handling missing values because we are dealing with categorical data in the stalk-root attribute. The mode, representing the most frequently occurring value, is more suitable in this context as it preserves the characteristics of the dataset while effectively addressing missing values.

**6. Save the Cleaned Dataset:** Finally, the cleaned dataset is saved to a new CSV file, and a confirmation message is printed.
