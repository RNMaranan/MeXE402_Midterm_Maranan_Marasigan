## 🕹️ Linear Regression

## 🎮 Purpose

## 🔧 Linear Regression Formula

The Linear regression equation is represented as:

$$
\huge
ŷ = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + ... + b_nX_n
$$

### Where:

- $$ŷ$$: Dependent variable. 
- $$b_0$$: y-intercept (constant term). 
- $$b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$$: Slope coefficients. 
- $$X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$$: Independent variables.

 ###
 
## 🕹️ Logistic Regression
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logistic regression, known as a logit model, is a data analysis technique that uses mathematics to predict a binary outcome based on prior observations of a data set. This is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

## 🎮 Purpose
- To predict binary or categorical outcomes.
- To estimate the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular category.

## 🔧 Logistic Regression Formula

The logistic regression equation is represented as:

$$
\huge
\ln \left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3X_3 + b_4X_4
$$

### Where:
- $$p$$: Probability of the event occurring.
- $$\(\frac{p}{1 - p}\)$$: Odds of the event occurring.
- $$\(\ln \left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right)\)$$: Natural logarithm of the odds.
- $$\(b_0\)$$: Intercept.
- $$\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\)$$: Coefficients for the independent variables.
- $$\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4\)$$: Independent variables.

This formula is used in logistic regression to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables.


## 🏁 Some Use Cases
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- Predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on demographic features.
- Diagnosing diseases as positive or negative based on symptoms and test results.
